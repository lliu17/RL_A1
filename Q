what I've done so far:
1. generate a nonstationary distribution 
    -> result: arm with highest mean will be selected most

2. nonstationary
    -> not choosing the highest mean

can we use the rank as a measure? e.g. 4th highest mean 

after we can do:
- change learning rate 
- try UCB/gradient bandit/greedy with optimistic initialization



questions
- q*(a) started out equal??

- + random: correct? time? 

- optimize weighted avg?

technical:
- matrix faster than loop?

- num of items in distribution

- perf: current mean? always changing - only compare the final distribution vs.
    rewards?

- graph
